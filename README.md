# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
Using Tableau, Citi Bike data for New York city was analyzed to get a better understanding of the business model. My friend Kate & I are interested in seeing if this service could be provided within Des Moines, Iowa at a profit. We have an angel investor, and are analyzing data to understand the scale and function of Citi Bike within New York.
